Code Challenge For Guaranteed Rate

Have been tinkering with the new .Net Core (1.0.1) architecture, 
in the commands txt file I found the two commands for the core command line interface to 
install the self-contained application for win 10 or osx 10 
//Publish Self-Contained Application
dotnet publish –runtime win10-x64
dotnet publish –runtime osx.10.11-x64

This is of course after you have installed the .Net Core Framework
Visual Studio 2015 Community for Windows or
Visual Studio Code for Mac

IF any trouble on Windows follow these instructions
https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowsvs2015
I used Visual Studio 2015 for my environment
